The data folder contains all the processed data used in the real-world experiments of the paper. The sources of all the data are cited in the paper accordingly.

The funcion.py file contains:
1. all the functions needed to perform link paritioning once the simplical complex is contructed as a networkx object;
2. the four evaluation metrics used;
3. the implementations of the baseline methods C, D, and E_1. The implementation of S can be found at github.com/yy/linkcomm.

The example.ipynb is a notebook giving an example of how to use the implementations and the data.
